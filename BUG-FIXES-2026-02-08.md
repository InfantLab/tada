# Ta-Da! Bug Fixes - 2026-02-08

## Issues Reported

### 1. Version Number Display
**Problem:** Version number appears out of date on Settings page  
**Location:** `/app/pages/settings.vue` line ~17  
**Current:** Hardcoded initial value "0.3.1"  
**Expected:** Should match package.json "0.4.0a"  
**Fix:** Update initial value to match current version

### 2. About Page Link Size
**Problem:** Link to About page at bottom of Settings is too small  
**Location:** `/app/pages/settings.vue` line ~1677  
**Current:** Small text link in footer  
**Suggested:** Make it more prominent to encourage users to read about Ta-Da!  
**Fix:** Increase font size, add styling to make it stand out

### 3. Categories Organization Link
**Problem:** "Manage Categories" link on Settings page doesn't navigate  
**Location:** `/app/pages/settings.vue` line ~1258  
**Target:** `/settings/categories` page exists at `/app/pages/settings/categories.vue`  
**Status:** Need to verify - link looks correct, might be runtime navigation issue  
**Fix:** Test navigation, check for console errors, verify page loads

### 4. BYOK UI Redundancy
**Problem:** Bring Your Own Keys section has redundant UI elements  
**Location:** `/app/components/settings/VoiceSettings.vue`  
**Current:** 
- LLM Provider selector has "OpenAI (BYOK)" and "Anthropic (BYOK)" options
- Separate API Keys section below with Add/Remove buttons for each provider
**Issue:** Users must both:
  1. Select "OpenAI (BYOK)" as LLM Provider
  2. Scroll down to add their OpenAI key
**Suggested:** Combine selection and key entry in one place  
**Options:**
  - A) Remove BYOK options from LLM Provider, make it auto-detect when keys added
  - B) Allow inline key entry when BYOK provider is selected
  - C) Show key status next to BYOK provider options

## Implementation Plan

1. ✅ Fix version number - Changed from "0.3.1" to "0.4.0a" in settings.vue
2. ✅ Make About link more prominent - Added emoji, larger font, color, better spacing
3. ⚠️ Test/fix Categories link - Page exists, link looks correct, needs runtime testing
4. ✅ Simplify BYOK UI - Improved flow:
   - Removed "(BYOK)" labels from LLM Provider options (redundant)
   - Changed "Always use..." to "Prefer..." to clarify fallback behavior
   - Updated descriptions to reference the BYOK section below
   - Made BYOK info text clearer about automatic usage

## Notes

- Version in package.json: `0.4.0a`
- All fixes should maintain mobile responsiveness
- Test in both light and dark modes
