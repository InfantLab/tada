## The Cult of Done Manifesto

**By Bre Pettis and Kio Stark (2009)**

The manifesto that crystallized the project's core philosophy: **done is the engine of more.**

Key principles that resonate with Ta-Da!:

1. There are three states of being: Not knowing, action, and completion.
2. Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done.
3. There is no editing stage.
4. Pretending you know what you're doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing.
5. Banish procrastination. If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.
6. The point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done.
7. Once you're done you can throw it away.
8. Laugh at perfection. It's boring and keeps you from being done.
9. People without dirty hands are wrong. Doing something makes you right.
10. Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.
11. Destruction is a variant of done.
12. If you have an idea and publish it on the internet, that counts as a ghost of done.
13. **Done is the engine of more.**

**Why it matters for Ta-Da!:**

- We celebrate completion, not perfection
- Every small win counts — even 30 seconds of meditation
- The app exists to notice what you've _done_, not to plan what you should do
- Failure counts. Trying counts. Showing up counts.
