# Specification Quality Checklist: Voice Input with LLM Processing

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: January 22, 2026  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation
- Spec ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- Key design decisions documented in Assumptions section
- Out of scope items clearly listed to prevent scope creep
